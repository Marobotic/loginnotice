<font color="#4286f4" size="4">Testers Rules:</font>
<br>
<font>1. Be respectful to other members; sharing your ideas and opinions are okay, as long as you're not harassing others. <br> 2. Offering your work and help does not give you ownership to the project regardless of it being apperciated! <br>3. Your items / progress / character data can and will be <br> <br> <br> wiped at any given moment, on the test server! <br>4. Joining the testing server would include the following rules:<br> <br>* Whatever progress / updates do you see here are not meant to be shared with anyone outside of the project<br>* All the files, server files, client files and future updates are fully owned by EA staff/owner <br>* We must all try to work professionally together at best! <br>* No fooling around, sure you may have access to gm commands, but this isn't a fun trip for messing around with gm commands; they're there to make testing easier / faster <br>* Any infringement of these rules puts you at risk of exclusion from the project and even banishment from Ethereal-Aion depending on the severity of your fault!</font>
